    <h3>About this dish</h3>
        <p>Green curry is a popular Thai dish believed to have originated in the early 20th century. It's made with green curry paste, coconut milk, veggies, and meat and/or seafood. The flavor base is traditionally made from a combination of green chilies, shrimp paste, garlic, shallots, lemongrass, peppercorns, makrut limes, and cumin seeds. It's spicy and flavorful and pairs perfectly with the sweetness of coconut milk.</p>
