                <li>Preheat oven to 350 F. Prepare a 10 inch tube pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the egg whites and use the whisk attachment to beat it until it is frothy. Add the cream of tartar and beat the egg whites until firm peaks form.</li>
                <li>Meanwile, in a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with a whisk until it is pale in color. Add the sugar and mix until it is incorporated. Add the water, oil and ube flavoring. Stir well until the color is distributed evenly.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the yolk batter, and stir well until the mixture is smooth. Gently fold the egg whites to the batter in three additions using a rubber spatula until the mixture is evenly colored.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter to a 10 inch tube pan. Set it over a baking sheet and bake at 350 F for 50-60 minutes, or until a knife inserted at the center of the cake comes out clean, To cool the cake, invert it on top of an overturned mug and allow it to cool completely.</li>
                <li>To unmold the cake, loosen sides with a knife. Using your hands, gently push the cake down and away from the sides of the pan. Remove the tube pan attachment and run a knife on the bottom of the cake to loosen. Invert the cake on a serving plate.</li>
